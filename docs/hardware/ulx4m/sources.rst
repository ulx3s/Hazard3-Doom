Original Design Sources and Further Reading
===========================================

This guide intentionally keeps upstream design material visible. Hazard3-Doom
adds interpretation and project-specific integration notes; it does not take
ownership of the ULX4M hardware design.

Primary ULX4M sources
---------------------

* `ULX4M on Crowd Supply <https://www.crowdsupply.com/intergalaktik/ulx4m>`_ -
  project overview and promoted LS/LD feature tables.
* `Intergalaktik ULX4M hardware repository <https://github.com/intergalaktik/ulx4m>`_ -
  KiCad design sources, schematics, PCB files, BOM material, constraints, and
  revision history.
* `Intergalaktik ULX4M documentation <https://github.com/intergalaktik/ulx4m-documentation>`_ -
  separate LS/LD user-manual material and DFU bootloader notes.
* `ULX4M examples <https://github.com/lawrie/ulx4m_examples>`_ - upstream example
  designs useful when comparing basic board mappings.

Hazard3-Doom sources
--------------------

The board-facing implementation used by this project lives mainly below:

.. code-block:: text

   third_party/Hazard3/example_soc/fpga/
   third_party/Hazard3/example_soc/synth/
   third_party/Hazard3/example_soc/soc/
   third_party/Hazard3/example_soc/third_party/LiteDRAM/
   bootloader/
   openocd/

The most important ULX4M files include the LS/LD top-level Verilog wrappers,
matching LPFs, ``ahb_litedram.v``, the generated LiteDRAM cores and editable YAML
profiles, the ULX4M makefiles, and the bootloader/OpenOCD configuration files.

How to use conflicting sources
------------------------------

Use a source hierarchy rather than assuming the newest-looking page is always
correct:

#. **The physical board in front of you** - markings and measured behavior win.
#. **Matching schematic/PCB/BOM revision** - best design-intent evidence.
#. **Matching LPF and project wrapper** - source of truth for what a specific
   Hazard3-Doom bitstream actually drives.
#. **Manufacturer datasheet for the fitted component** - electrical/timing
   limits and geometry.
#. **Campaign pages, READMEs, examples, and forum posts** - valuable context,
   but often revision-dependent.

When a discrepancy matters to a build, document it in the project instead of
silently resolving it locally. That keeps the next board owner from having to
repeat the same investigation.
