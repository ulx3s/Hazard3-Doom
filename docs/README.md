# Hazard3-Doom Read the Docs source

This directory contains the Sphinx documentation for Hazard3-Doom.

See [app.readthedocs.org/dashboard](https://app.readthedocs.org/dashboard/) for publishing status.

## Local build

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv-docs
source .venv-docs/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
python -m sphinx -W --keep-going -b html docs docs/_build/html
```

Open `docs/_build/html/index.html`.


## Localization

Hazard3-Doom uses Read the Docs projects with [multiple languages](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/latest/localization.html):

> Each language must have its own project on Read the Docs. You will choose one to be the parent project, and add each of the other projects as "Translations" of the parent project.

Create each translation project from the same repository and branch, with a language suffix in the Read the Docs project name, for example `-hr` or `-fr`.

Add each new project as a [translation](./images/readthedocs-add-translation.png) of the English parent project. The [Croatian project setup](./images/readthedocs-localization-project.png) is an example.

Build the Croatian documentation with:

```bash
READTHEDOCS_LANGUAGE=hr python -m sphinx -W --keep-going -b html docs docs/_build/html-hr
```

Build the French documentation with:

```bash
READTHEDOCS_LANGUAGE=fr python -m sphinx -W --keep-going -b html docs docs/_build/html-fr
```

Open `docs/_build/html-hr/index.html` or `docs/_build/html-fr/index.html`.

The repository-root `.readthedocs.yaml` is the build configuration used by Read the Docs. Each translated Read the Docs project should use its matching language and be linked as a translation of the English project. All language projects can use the same repository and branch; `docs/conf.py` selects the translated source tree from `READTHEDOCS_LANGUAGE`.

### Language-scoped search

Each generated Sphinx build is already language-scoped: `docs/conf.py` excludes the physical `fr/` and `hr/` source trees from normal discovery, then substitutes only the translated source selected by `READTHEDOCS_LANGUAGE`. The built-in Sphinx `searchindex.js` therefore contains only the current language.

Read the Docs Server Side Search is a separate service and overrides Sphinx search when its search UI is enabled. With separate Read the Docs projects linked as translations, that can expose results outside the language represented by the current Sphinx build. For Hazard3-Doom, search results should remain local to the current language.

For the English parent and every translation project:

1. Open the Read the Docs dashboard for that project.
2. Open **Settings** -> **Search**.
3. Disable **Enable search modal**.
4. Rebuild the active version.
5. Verify searches independently under `/en/latest/`, `/fr/latest/`, and `/hr/latest/`.

This intentionally keeps the Read the Docs translation/version flyout while using the per-build Sphinx search index for documentation search. The current `.readthedocs.yaml` schema exposes server-side search ranking and ignore rules, but does not provide a repository setting for the dashboard search-modal toggle, so apply this setting to each language project.

Translated human-language prose under `docs/<language>/` is UTF-8 and should use the native characters required by that language. Keep source code, scripts, CI, filenames, command literals, identifiers, paths, protocol strings, and other machine-facing text unchanged unless the underlying interface itself changes.
