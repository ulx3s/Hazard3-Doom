Hazard3 RISC-V Processor
========================

Hazard3 is the processor at the center of Hazard3-Doom. It is a compact,
in-order, three-stage 32-bit RISC-V CPU designed for FPGA and ASIC use. The
Hazard3 project also provides the surrounding debug hardware and example SoC
integration used to turn the CPU core into a usable system.

This section explains the processor from an educational point of view and,
just as importantly, separates the **standard Hazard3 design** from the
**ULX3S/Hazard3-Doom integration** built around it.


The Raspberry Pi RP2350 connection
----------------------------------

Hazard3 is also one of the processor architectures built into Raspberry Pi's
RP2350 microcontroller. RP2350 contains two open-hardware Hazard3 RISC-V cores
alongside two Arm Cortex-M33 cores; software or OTP configuration selects which
processor pair is used. RP2350 is the microcontroller used by Raspberry Pi Pico
2 and Pico 2 W.

That makes the processor in Hazard3-Doom especially interesting educationally:
the FPGA project is built around the same open-source Hazard3 processor design
used in a mass-produced Raspberry Pi microcontroller. It is not, however, a
claim that the two synthesized CPUs are configured identically. Hazard3 is
parameterized, and RP2350 enables a different set of ISA extensions, custom
extensions, debug features, and SoC integration than the Hazard3-Doom FPGA
configuration described below.

The technical descriptions in these pages are anchored to the Hazard3 source

.. important::

   The pinned SHA is the authority for the FPGA build described here. Upstream
   Hazard3 continues to evolve. A feature present in current upstream
   ``stable`` or ``develop`` is not automatically present in this project
   until the Hazard3 submodule is deliberately updated.

What is upstream Hazard3?
-------------------------

The processor RTL under ``hdl/`` is upstream Hazard3 architecture: the
three-stage core, instruction front end, decoder, arithmetic units, CSRs,
interrupt logic, debug-mode hooks, register file, PMP support, triggers, and
the one-port/two-port CPU wrappers. The same architectural module families are
present in current upstream Hazard3.

Upstream also supplies a minimal example SoC and RISC-V debug implementation.
The normal upstream example is intentionally small: processor, debug, RAM,
UART, and a platform timer are enough to demonstrate and debug the CPU.

What is customized for Hazard3-Doom?
------------------------------------

The ULX3S fork expands the example-SoC and board-integration layer rather than
turning Hazard3 into a Doom-specific CPU. Project additions include external
SDRAM support, video access, SD-card SPI, SAO/ESP32 integration, board pin and
ownership logic, and a preloaded resident monitor image.

That boundary is useful when learning the design:

Actual ULX3S processor configuration
------------------------------------

The pinned ULX3S FPGA wrapper selects a performance-oriented RV32I
configuration. The important effective settings are:
