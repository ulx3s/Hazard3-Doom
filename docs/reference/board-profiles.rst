The monitor, linked Doom image, and SDRAM memory map must agree on the memory
profile. Complete board build wrappers set their target-specific profile and
clock automatically.

Default nextpnr routing settings
--------------------------------

The board wrappers obtain their routing defaults from one common implementation,
``scripts/build-ecp5-bitstream-common.sh``. The current assignments are included
directly from that file so the documentation does not maintain another copy:

.. literalinclude:: ../../scripts/build-ecp5-bitstream-common.sh
   :language: bash
   :start-at: ULX3S_85F_DEFAULT_NEXTPNR_SEED=
   :end-at: ULX4M_LD_85F_DEFAULT_NEXTPNR_HEAP_TIMINGWEIGHT=

``NEXTPNR_SEED`` can still override the selected board default for an explicit
route. Treat the defaults as release baselines, not permanent optima.

Current FPGA validation
-----------------------

The routed values below are regression checkpoints collected from project
builds. Exact source revisions, netlist hashes, CAD-tool versions, memory-device
profile, and nextpnr settings are part of the result; seed numbers are not
portable timing guarantees.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 12 38 28

   * - Board
     - Seed
     - Routed result
     - Status
   * - ULX3S 85F
     - 11
     - ``clk_sys`` 52.24 MHz
     - PASS at 50 MHz
   * - ULX3S 12F
     - 82
     - ``clk_sys`` 42.70 MHz
     - PASS at 40 MHz
   * - ULX4M-LD 85F
     - 83
     - ``clk_sys`` 43.63 MHz; LiteDRAM user 67.51 MHz
     - PASS at 40 MHz / 60 MHz; selected release route

These release-route rows intentionally keep the seed explicit because it is
part of the timing result's provenance. The default values themselves are
owned by the common build script above.

The hardware-qualified ULX4M-LD checkpoint is substantially stronger than the
older ``ALLOW_TIMING_FAILURE`` development state. The exact frozen netlist was:

.. code-block:: text

   160c536b12e46667990c887571da6f443ccc6c5a2ba644033db43fc783ea9453

The timing-passing hardware-qualified route used nextpnr seed 2 with HeAP
``timingweight=30``. The exact locally tested bitstream had SHA256:

.. code-block:: text

   294602982dfc4a9906961f2e8b6f43de925d8c11a7e5e6bb0f5e392965a868de

The same frozen netlist failed with the earlier HeAP ``timingweight=10``
setting, showing why the place-and-route settings are part of the qualification
record rather than an incidental detail.

Hardware validation on the Micron board then passed the complete ``q`` SDRAM
qualification suite, 40 MiB heap stress, Doom platform smoke test, and copied
RV32 execution from DDR. A timing PASS alone is not sufficient to claim DDR
qualification.

A new resident-monitor preload or any other synthesis-visible change creates a
new netlist. Preserve the qualified seed-2 artifact as a reference, then rerun
routing and hardware qualification for the new netlist. See :doc:`timing-sweeps`
for sweep provenance and comparison rules.
